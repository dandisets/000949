description: "We designed and simulated a novel 64-element random array ultrasound
  transducer which is electrophysiology-compatible and is wearable. The project promises
  to develop a wearable ultrasound neuromodulation transducer array system, integrated
  with electrophysiological recordings in awake behaving animals, thus significantly
  advancing our ability to interrogate neural circuits in various behaving animal
  models with a high spatiotemporal resolution and has tremendous potential for translation
  to clinical utility.\n\nThis dataset includes 5 .mat files with formatted transcranial
  focused ultrasound simulation pressure magnitude data (variable: us_mag). Each file
  name is marked with the transcranial brain targets, e.g., S1HL, insula, thalamus,
  that are responsible for pain signal processing. Other two .mat files have the formatted
  ultrasound pressure field when the ultrasound targets at a sham location or when
  the transducer is working in the coherent mode, i.e., all elements transmitting
  ultrasound simultaneously. When the tFUS targeted at S1HL, insula, thalamus and
  sham locations, the H276 was steering its focus by certain distances. These distances
  were listed in our preprinted work shown below. The spatial step sizes of the 3D
  matrix (us_mag) are included in each of these files (variable: delta_x, delta_y,
  delta_z).\n\nThe simulations were implemented in Sim4Life V7.0 in the presence of
  a mouse skull model (CT image based). This work was supported in part by NIH EB029354,
  NS124564, and NS131069. More information can be found in the corresponding manuscript:"
